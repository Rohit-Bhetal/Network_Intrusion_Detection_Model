# Network Intrusion Detection Dataset Analysis:

### Overview:

This dataset pertains to network intrusion detection, where the goal is to classify network connections as either normal or anomalous (intrusive). The data contains various features related to network activity, and the 'class' column indicates whether a connection is normal or an anomaly.

### Columns:

1\. **duration:** Duration of the connection in seconds.

2\. **protocol_type:** Type of network protocol used (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp).

3\. **service:** Type of service (e.g., ftp_data, private).

4\. **flag:** Connection status (e.g., SF for normal, REJ for rejected).

5\. **src_bytes:** Number of bytes sent from source to destination.

6\. **dst_bytes:** Number of bytes sent from destination to source.

7\. **land:** Binary feature indicating if the connection is from/to the same host/port.

8\. **wrong_fragment:** Number of wrong fragments.

9\. **urgent:** Number of urgent packets.

10\. **hot:** Number of 'hot' indicators.

11\. **num_failed_logins:** Number of failed login attempts.

12\. **logged_in:** Binary feature indicating if successfully logged in.

13\. **num_compromised:** Number of compromised conditions.

14\. **root_shell:** Binary feature indicating if root shell is obtained.

15\. **su_attempted:** Binary feature indicating if 'su root' command attempted.

16\. **num_root:** Number of root accesses.

17\. **num_file_creations:** Number of file creations.

18\. **num_shells:** Number of shell prompts.

19\. **num_access_files:** Number of operations on access control files.

20\. **num_outbound_cmds:** Number of outbound commands (constant value, can be dropped).

21\. **is_host_login:** Binary feature indicating if host login is attempted.

22\. **is_guest_login:** Binary feature indicating if guest login is attempted.

23\. **count:** Number of connections to the same host as the current connection.

24\. **srv_count:** Number of connections to the same service as the current connection.

25\. **serror_rate:** Percentage of connections that have 'SYN' errors.

26\. **srv_serror_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same service with 'SYN' errors.

27\. **rerror_rate:** Percentage of connections that have 'REJ' errors.

28\. **srv_rerror_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same service with 'REJ' errors.

29\. **same_srv_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same service.

30\. **diff_srv_rate:** Percentage of connections to different services.

31\. **srv_diff_host_rate:** Percentage of connections to different hosts for the same service.

32\. **dst_host_count:** Number of connections to the same host as the current connection.

33\. **dst_host_srv_count:** Number of connections to the same service as the current connection.

34\. **dst_host_same_srv_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same service.

35\. **dst_host_diff_srv_rate:** Percentage of connections to different services.

36\. **dst_host_same_src_port_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same source port.

37\. **dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate:** Percentage of connections to different hosts for the same service.

38\. **dst_host_serror_rate:** Percentage of connections that have 'SYN' errors.

39\. **dst_host_srv_serror_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same service with 'SYN' errors.

40\. **dst_host_rerror_rate:** Percentage of connections that have 'REJ' errors.

41\. **dst_host_srv_rerror_rate:** Percentage of connections to the same service with 'REJ' errors.

42\. **class:** Binary label indicating if the connection is normal ('normal') or an anomaly ('anomaly').

### Data Exploration:

The training dataset contains 25,192 rows and 42 columns, while the testing dataset has 22,544 rows and 41 columns. The target variable is 'class,' with 13,449 instances of 'normal' and 11,743 instances of 'anomaly.'

### Selected Features for Analysis:

The following features are selected for analysis based on their potential relevance:

- **Numerical Features:**

  - src_bytes

  - dst_bytes

  - hot

  - count

  - srv_count

  - same_srv_rate

  - dst_host_count

  - dst_host_srv_count

  - dst_host_same_srv_rate

  - dst_host_diff_srv_rate

  - dst_host_same_src_port_rate

  - dst_host_rerror_rate

- **Categorical Features:**

  - protocol_type

  - service

  - flag

These features are chosen for their potential significance in distinguishing between normal and anomalous network connections.

### Data Analysis Steps:

1\. **Data Loading:**

   - Load the dataset using Pandas.

2\. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Handle any missing values or irrelevant columns.

   - Explore basic statistics and distributions.

3\. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Visualize the distribution of the target variable ('class').

   - Explore the relationships between selected features and the target.

4\. **Feature Selection:**

   - Identify and explain the rationale for selecting specific features for analysis.

5\. **Modeling (if applicable):**

   - If the goal is to build a predictive model, perform necessary preprocessing.

   - Train a model and evaluate its performance.

### Additional Notes:

- The 'num_outbound_cmds' feature has a constant value and can be dropped.

- The dataset appears imbalanced, with more instances of 'normal' connections than 'anomaly' connections.

### Conclusion:

This dataset provides an opportunity to analyze network connections and detect anomalies. The selected features will be used to explore patterns and relationships that can help distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. If the goal is classification, modeling techniques may be applied to build a predictive model.
